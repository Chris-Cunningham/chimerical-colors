<p>Javascript code to allow you to see impossible colors.</p>

<p>The relevant paper is "Chimerical Colors: Some Phenomenological Predictions from Cognitive Neuroscience" by Paul Churchland, in the journal Philosophical Psychology, Vol. 18 No. 5, October 2005, pp. 527-560.</p>

<p>The basic idea is that there are several models for how our eyes process colors, but the best reason to believe in a model is to have it predict something unexpected, then go out and test to see if the unexpected thing really happens.</p>

<p>One model of human color recognition is the Hurvich-Jameson opponent-process network. The surprising thing it predicts is that it should be possible to "see" colors that are not actually possible colors of any real-world object. This is done by wearing out certain receptors in your eyes and then quickly looking at a certain background color. The resulting image will be a color that we would normally think of impossible, like a brilliant blue that is somehow also pitch-black.</p>

<p>The code here will do a couple of things. </p>

<p>First, we want a model that allows you to input S, M, L, and B (short, medium, long-wavelength excitement and general brightness) and get an output of Agr, Aby, and Awb, which parameterize how we actually see color according to the H-J model. If you input S, M, L, and B with various real-world values, then we hope to be able to see that the possible outputs do not completely fill the target space parametrized by Agr, Aby, and Abw.</p>

<p>Then, we want to actually set up the mechanisms that allow us to see the colors outside of this target, like the impossibly-dark blues. Basically we should be able to pick a tuple Agr, Aby, and Awb, and then the code should show us two images in order that allow us to experience the weird color.</p>
