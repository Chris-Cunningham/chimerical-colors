The surprising thing it predicts is that it should be possible to \"see\" colors that are not actually possible colors of any real-world object. This is done by wearing out certain receptors in your eyes and then quickly looking at a certain background color. The resulting image will be a color that we would normally think of impossible, like a brilliant blue that is somehow also pitch-black.\r\n\r\nThe code here will do a couple of things. \r\n\r\nFirst, we want a model that allows you to input S, M, L, and B (short, medium, long-wavelength excitement and general brightness) and get an output of Agr, Aby, and Awb, which parameterize how we actually see color according to the H-J model. If you input S, M, L, and B with various real-world values, then we hope to be able to see that the possible outputs do not completely fill the target space parametrized by Agr, Aby, and Abw.\r\n\r\nThen, we want to actually set up the mechanisms that allow us to see the colors outside of this target, like the impossibly-dark blues. Basically we should be able to pick a tuple Agr, Aby, and Awb, and then the code should show us two images in order that allow us to experience the weird color.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
